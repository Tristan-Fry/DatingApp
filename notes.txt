This is a test
Migrations
---------------
We needed to search nuget dotnet-ef and install it in order to allow us to migrate:
    using the following command:
        dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 7.0.9
    We can also use this command to see the list of tools we have installed:
        dotnet tool list -g

We then use this command to migrate:
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations

    This will create the migrations folder in the Data folder

Creating Database
----------------------
To create the database:
    dotnet ef database update 

-Note we need the SQLite extension to view the database.
-Now in the explorer tab we can see the SQLITE explorer tab.
